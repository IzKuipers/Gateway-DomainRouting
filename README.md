# Gateway Domain Routing

This project is written for the Gateway SRV05 server of my home infrastructure. The Gateway server is responsible for receiving the incoming HTTP traffic and routing it to the various servers in the infrastructure. Currently this routing is handled with a bash file and a handful of text files each containing a list of (sub-)domains, but I'd like to be able to manage these domains from my web browsers so that I don't have to crack open a terminal every time I want to reroute a domain or whatever the case may be.
